      "body": "Spanish auditors have ordered former Catalan leader Artur Mas and nine others to repay \u20ac4.9 million of public money spent on a non-binding independence vote in 2014.\n\nThe 2014 vote was a symbolic ballot by pro-independence campaigners, and was declared illegal by Spain's Constitutional Court.\n\nHeld after efforts to hold a formal vote were blocked by the government, it saw 80% of 2.2 million voters back secession.\n\nThe Court of Auditors cited Mas as being the main responsible party for repaying the fine.\n\nMas was barred from public office for two years in Mach 2017 over the informal referendum. However, he has continued to be vocal about his hopes for Catalan independence.\n\nCarles Puigdemont, who succeeded Mas, condemned the decision to fine the former leader.\n\nTaking to Twitter, he described the order as \"an abuse and an unworthy arbitrary act\".\n\nPuigdemont held his own referendum last October, before declaring independence for the wealthy northwestern region.\n\nThe declaration prompted Madrid to take control of Catalonia, while arrest warrants were issued for many of the organisers.\n\nPuigdemont fled the country amid the efforts to arrest him, and currently lives in self-imposed exile in Brussels.",

      "title": "Catalonia: a year on, political prisoners go unnoticed by the rest of the world",
      "body": "After an unofficial referendum in October 2017, the pro-independence political parties in the Catalan parliament unilaterally declared independence from Spain. In response, the Spanish government invoked Article 155 of the Spanish Constitution which effectively suspended the region's autonomy.\n\nMore than a year on from these events, ousted Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont remains in exile in Belgium. Another six pro-independence leaders remain in exile, including Clara Ponsati, former education minister in the Catalan government who has returned to her employment as an economics professor at the University of St Andrews, in Scotland. Although not formally charged, like the other exiled leaders, were she to return to Spain she would likely be arrested on charges of rebellion and misuse of public funds. She has been critical of Europe's leaders for their silence on the Catalan question and has claimed that Catalan political prisoners are being used as pawns to deactivate the pro-independence movement.\n\nTwo activists and seven politicians remain in custody. They have been charged by Spain's attorney general with rebellion and misuse of public funds. This ignores an earlier decision by Spain's solicitor general, who recently downgraded the charge of rebellion to sedition because the former charge requires the use of violence. The available evidence suggests that violence was not used by any of those in jail. Nevertheless, if the attorney general continues his hardline stance, those in jail could face up to 25 years behind bars. Many will be surprised to hear that Spain's legal system allows people to be held on precautionary, pre-trial detention for such a long time.\n\nThe group facing charges of rebellion includes two civil society activists Jordi Sanchez, president of the campaign group Catalan National Assembly (ANC), and Jordi Cuixart, president of the campaign group Omnium Cultural. Both are facing up to 17 years in jail. Both have been detained since October 2017 in connection with protests in Barcelona on September 20 and 21 that year. The protests were aimed at obstructing police raids to seize material related to the referendum from Catalan government buildings.\n\nYet Amnesty International's director in Europe, Gauri Van Gulik, noted that \"although calling protests to obstruct legitimate police operations can - if proof is produced of their commission - constitute a public order offence, it does not constitute a serious crime such as sedition or rebellion\". Amnesty has called for the immediate release of the \"two Jordis\", as they have become known across Catalonia.\n\nAmnesty avoids using the term \"political prisoner\" as there is no accepted definition in international law. However, over 1,000 legal experts have signed a manifesto arguing that the Catalan leaders in jail are effectively that. They say the accused have not been given time to prepare their defence, making a farce of the legal proceedings. Similarly, 53.4% of Catalans consider that those in jail are political prisoners. And 60% feel that the judicial proceedings against them are unjustified. It's worth noting that that's a higher percentage than the estimated number of Catalans who support independence.\n\nOthers, connected with the Committees for the Defence of the Republic - groups campaigning for the unofficial referendum result to be upheld - were charged with public disorder offences following a protest in Barcelona on February 23 2018. They could face two and a half years in prison.\n\nIn their resistance to the Spanish authorities, Catalans are drawing on a long tradition. Today's political prisoners, whether accurately labelled or not, are the latest in a long line who have fought against the perceived injustices of the Spanish state. Foremost among these is Lluis Companys, the president of the generalitat who was arrested for declaring the Catalan republic on October 6 1934 and was executed by firing squad on October 15 1940. The historic parallel is not lost on the Catalan people. Nor it seems was the parallel lost on the right-wing Popular Party's spokesperson, Pablo Casado, who threatened Puigdemont, ahead of the unilateral declaration of independence, with the same fate as Companys.\n\nSpain's Supreme Court has ordered that 18 former Catalan leaders stand trial for their role in the unilateral declaration of independence in 2017. The charges against them include rebellion, sedition, the misuse of public funds and disobedience. The trial is likely to take place in early 2019.\n\nThe issue of Catalan independence will not be solved by judicial actions. Politics is required. Pedro Sanchez, the socialist prime minister, has certainly taken a softer line than his predecessor, Mariano Rajoy. Nevertheless, the political negotiations necessary to solve the crisis will require a stronger government than the current minority socialist administration. It will also require the Catalan pro-independence parties to present a more united front than is currently the case. And ultimately, it will be hard to have any meaningful negotiations while there are political prisoners. Carla Ponsati's lawyer in Scotland, Aamer Anwar, has said that 'Talking to Spain now is like sitting down with a gangster holding hostages'. A long road lies ahead.",

      "title": "MEPs blast harsh sentences for Catalan political prisoners",
      "body": "The EU-Catalonia dialogue platform has signed a joint statement expressing its deep concern at the \"harsh\" sentences demanded by the Spanish prosecutor for Catalan political prisoners who had \"peacefully and democratically\" pursued their nation's right to self-determination.\n\nSeveral Catalan pro-independence leaders have been in pre-trial detention for more than a year following their role in organising Catalonia's self-determination referendum in October 2017.\n\nOriol Junqueras and Ra\u00fcl Romeva, two former MEPs from the Greens\/European Free Alliance group, are among those held. Their trial is expected to be held early next year.\n\nRELATED CONTENT\n\nA joint statement signed by members of the EU-Catalonia dialogue platform, set up to promote a \"stronger role for the EU as a mediator\" in the current spat between Spain and Catalonia, has now been sent to the Spanish authorities.\n\nIn the statement the MEPs say: \"We, the members of the EU-Catalonia Dialogue Platform, want to express our deep concern about the request of the Spanish prosecutor to demand a total of 177 years in prison for the Catalan pro-independence leaders, who have been in pre-trial jail for more than a year for having organised a referendum on self-determination.\"\n\nAccording to voting figures provided by the Catalan government, approximately 90 percent of the votes cast were in favour of independence.\n\nLast Friday, the attorney general of Spain's Supreme Court, formally charged Junqueras, the former Catalan vice-president, with rebellion, and demanded a 25-year sentence for him. The former Catalan government ministers Joaquim Forn, Jordi Turull, Josep Rull, Ra\u00fcl Romeva and Dolors Bassa all face 16-year sentences.\n\n\"Catalan leaders have been accused of crimes they have not committed based on violence that has not existed\"\n\nJordi Cuixart and Jordi S\u00e0nchez, the president and former leader of the two main Catalan grassroots movements respectively, and Carme Forcadell, the former speaker in the Catalan parliament, face 17 years as \"promoters and leaders\" of the rebellion.\n\nAccording to the court papers, the defendants were \"aware\" that violence could have erupted during the attempt to bring about the independence of Catalonia, and they are accused of a \"general uprising, leading to acts of force, aggression and violence.\"\n\nIn the statement, the MEPs say, \"Not only are these accusations false and made up to fit into a narrative that justifies the charge of rebellion, but they have also been refuted by the Belgian and German courts, when they refused to extradite the former Catalan President Carles Puigdemont (twice) and the ministers in exile on the grounds of rebellion.\"\n\nPuigdemont is currently in exile in Belgium.\n\nThe statement goes on, \"Catalan leaders have been accused of crimes they have not committed based on violence that has not existed. Furthermore, the fact that the press had access to the document before the lawyers of the defendants is, once again, clear evidence of the many irregularities and violations of the rights of the defendants that are surrounding this cause.\"\n\n\"The decision to pursue the most serious charges laid against the accused has destroyed any hope that the socialist government might lead to any meaningful negotiation on the Catalan issue. The lack of political response by the Spanish authorities is provoking dramatic consequences and we will do what it is in our hands to denounce it. There has been no crime; this construction has nothing to do with reality.\"\n\nThe MEPs said that if such sentences are passed it would set a \"dangerous\" precedent in Spain and the European Union.\n\n\"The already shrinking position of the EU as guarantor of fundamental rights would be irreversibly affected; and its silence has also contributed to make European citizens feel that the European Institutions are far away and do not really protect them as they are supposed to.\"\n\n\"For all these reasons, we want to make a call to the European institutions to urgently reconsider what protecting, promoting and guaranteeing civil and political rights mean to them,\" the statement added.",

      "title": "Spain's judges back in spotlight after 'lack of impartiality' verdict",
      "body": "It was a scene many Spaniards had dreaded. On November 6th, Arnaldo Otegi, the leading Basque separatist politician who once served jail time for his involvement with terrorist group Eta, hugged his lawyer and hailed what he called a moment of \"poetic justice\".\n\nThe European Court of Human Rights had just ruled that the 2010 trial of Otegi and four others before Spain's high court, for allegedly reforming the outlawed Batasuna party, had been flawed. The Strasbourg tribunal had found that the presiding Spanish judge in the case, \u00c1ngela Murillo, who jailed the five defendants, \"had shown a lack of impartiality\" due to comments she had made during a separate trial of Otegi.\n\n\"Today their big lie has been revealed,\" tweeted Otegi after the ruling, adding that \"Spain has been revealed for what it is: an anti-democratic state\".\n\nThis case was particularly noteworthy, because of its international dimension. But it was just one of several which have dealt a blow to the image of the Spanish judiciary at a time when it has been forced into the spotlight.\n\nOn the same day, Spain's supreme court performed a dramatic U-turn on a ruling it had made two weeks earlier on who should pay a mortgage tax. In the initial decision, the court had ruled that banks, not their customers, should pay, signalling a major change. As banks braced themselves for a flood of lawsuits from customers reclaiming the taxes they had paid in the past, the supreme court announced it was taking the unprecedented move of reconsidering its own ruling.\n\nIn its revised judgment, the court decided that bank customers should pay the tax after all, to the relief of the financial sector and the outrage of many Spaniards.\n\n\"The mortgage tax ruling has been the last straw and Spain cannot afford to see yet another case like this,\" noted political commentator Jos\u00e9 Antonio G\u00f3mez. \"The biggest pending revolution of our democracy is that which should take place in the courts.\"\n\nOther, very different, cases have also put some of the country's main tribunals in the eye of the storm. In recent months, the high court has handed a string of jail sentences to rappers, artists and Twitter users for terrorism-related offences. The Mallorcan rapper Josep Miquel Arenas, known as Valt\u00f2nyc, has fled to Belgium, to avoid a 3\u00bd-year sentence for threats, glorifying terrorism and insulting the monarchy in his lyrics. Arenas has claimed that his prosecution is part of a far-right conspiracy to muzzle leftist voices. Now a poster-boy for freedom of speech activists, he is waiting to see if he will be extradited.\n\nAmong those supporting him are Catalan nationalists. Nine independence leaders have been in custody for the last year or so awaiting a trial for their role in Catalonia's failed bid for secession in 2017. Earlier this month, the attorney general's office confirmed it will seek jail terms of up to 25 years for them and nine other defendants in the trial, which is likely to be the most politically significant Spain has seen for decades although it still has no date.\n\nWith the independence movement casting the justice system as an undemocratic tool of unionist forces in Madrid, the Catalan impasse has magnified the political repercussions of every judicial decision related to it.\n\nCarles Puigdemont, the exiled former president of Catalonia, scored a victory against the Spanish supreme court earlier this year when a German tribunal refused to extradite him on rebellion charges. Since then, Puigdemont has placed Spain \"alongside Kazakhstan among the criminal states which refuse to submit to the principles that govern fundamental universal rights.\"\n\nIn Spain, political parties have always tried to exert substantial control on the justice system\n\nSuch opinions are exasperating to many, particularly on the political right and within the judiciary itself. The APM conservative judges' association has defended the legal action being taken against the Catalan independence leaders as having full guarantees and it has rejected claims that the defendants are political prisoners. In recent days, the same organisation has warned of how \"easy it is right now to join those who promote the discrediting of the Spanish justice system\".\n\nYet a 2018 European Commission Scorecard, which ranked public confidence in the independence of countries' courts and judges, placed Spain a lowly 23rd, behind Romania and Latvia (Ireland was sixth).\n\n\"In Spain, political parties have always tried to exert substantial control on the justice system,\" the magistrate Joaquim Bosch, co-author of a recent book about failings in the country's judiciary, told The Irish Times.\n\nBosch points to the General Council for the Judiciary (CGPJ) as a root of the problem. Its members are appointed by politicians and it in turns selects top-ranking judges, embedding political preferences into the system's upper echelons. \"If you don't appoint the very best people then there will always be a suspicion that those who have links to political power are the ones being promoted,\" he said.\n\nMany within the judiciary are also unhappy at what they see as a lack of resources. The government has been trying to negotiate with judges and prosecutors in recent days in an effort to persuade them not to stage a strike next week, the second such action they have organised this year.\n\nOne indicator of how Spaniards' view of their magistrates has changed has been visible since April, when a court in Navarre controversially absolved five men of raping a woman in 2016, in the so-called \"Manada\" case. Such was the vilification of the three judges involved that they now reportedly have bodyguards.\n\nMany believe the judiciary started losing prestige before both that case and the Catalan conflict, during Spain's economic crisis. The torrent of corruption and bank mismanagement cases from that period left courts inundated and, in some cases, behaving in ways that were seen to favour economic and political powers.\n\nThis winter, Spain is commemorating 40 years of its constitution, the document that laid down the foundations for its entire democratic system. But with one of its key institutions struggling for credibility, the celebrations will be somewhat muted.",

      "body": "That being said, the straits of Gibraltar have played witness to an ever increasing amount of migrant crossings into Europe, with the EU remaining divided over how to cope with the influx. These divisions have seen the relatively small, yet noticeable rise in popularity of the so called VOX party; which echoes American President Donald Trump by proposing to \"make Spain great again\" and promoting a throwback to the Franco era, with a focus on controlling immigration and resisting Catalan separatism.\n\n\u00a9 REUTERS \/ Juan MedinaSpain's Prime Minister Trying 'Awkwardly' to End Franco's Legacy - ProfessorSputnik spoke with Duncan Wheeler, Professor Of Modern Spanish studies at the University Of Leeds to get his views on populism in Spain.\n\nSputnik: Why has Spain so far been one of the countries in Europe that has not seen a surge in populist politics, does this VOX party have potential to grow in popularity?\n\nDuncan Wheeler: It depends on the definition that you have for populism. The detractors of Podemos very much claim that it's a populist party, but I think traditionally what's been the case is that right from the transition onwards, really the kind of Spector of the Civil War, where Spain saw such a bloody conflict, caused to a certain extent by radical politics, means that Spaniards have consistently opted for the middle ground and consensus.\n\nI think they've generally paid too high a price for moderation and what's happening with VOX; which is a very interesting and disturbing phenomenon, is the fact that Partido Popular, when you look at Rajoy and when you look at what the international press were talking about in terms of the Catalan referendum, Rajoy was very much criticised as intransigent for sending the police in and disproportionate measures taken against, what some consider to be political prisoners, but actually it was a huge sway for Spain, who criticised him for being too indecisive and not taking action and especially the post corruption scandals, which led to him being ousted.\n\n\u00a9 AP Photo\/ Alvaro BarrientosCatalan Parliament Passes Resolution to Abolish Monarchy in SpainVOX has sort of cornered a part of the market where they've said we're not ashamed of being Spanish, we're going to protect Spanish interests and we're not tainted by the associations with the Partido Popular and that this is a kind of new beginning.\n\nWhat's interesting about VOX; is that they are still being quite cautious in the way they express themselves. They make a big point about them being normal, everyday people who aren't radicals.\n\nAs we know, that can provoke all sorts of discourse, but Spain always had a strange mixture of casual racism, but not the kind of systematic violence that we've seen in say Italy.\n\nAgain; that goes back to this ethos of tolerance and live and let live, which has been strained at the moment, but is still a legacy of both the Civil War and the transition.\n\nSputnik: Where do you feel the majority of Spanish people stand on EU membership?\n\n\u00a9 AFP 2018 \/ 'Dig Him Up': Spanish Parliament Amends Law, Orders Franco's ExhumationDuncan Wheeler: Europe's always been the goal for Spain and it's very much related to its sense of national self-esteem. If you go back to the 1960's when it was denied entry to what was then the European Economic Union; they took taking part in Eurovision phenomenally seriously, because that was seen as a compensation prize.\n\nIn the 1980's; Felipe Gonzalez, the then Prime Minister, was forgiven of almost anything by the Spanish population, in exchange for Spaniards not having to join different queues at European airports.\n\nSpaniards really can't understand Brexit, they see it as why would you voluntarily leave Europe? That said; both actually for the first time on the left and right, the financial crisis and the perception of Angela Merkel as some kind of vampiric force in Europe, has for the first time led to people vocalising doubts about Europe and the European project.\n\nViews and opinions expressed in this article are those of Duncan Wheeler and do not necessarily reflect those of Sputnik.",

      "body": "A rally demanding the release of Catalan political prisoners In Barcalona on September 11.\n\nIn recent weeks, senior judges in the loftiest halls of the Spanish legal system -- the Supreme Court, the National High Court and the Constitutional Court -- have been exposed as subverters of a fair legal process, lackeys of Spain's almighty banking elite and bumbling incompetents, writes Dick Nichols from Barcelona.\n\nThe revelations of their unfitness to judge guarantees the Spanish legal establishment's impending show trials of Catalan political leaders and law officers will be the most politically explosive since the transition from the Franco dictatorship in the late 1970s.\n\nNext January, 18 former Catalan ministers, MPs and social movement leaders will stand trial in the Supreme Court for having allegedly organised Catalonia's \"unlawful\" independence referendum October 1 last year. Nine have been in preventive detention for more than a year. The charges they face range from rebellion and embezzlement to disobeying court orders.\n\nAfter a verdict is brought down in that case, former Catalan chief of police Josep Llu\u00eds Trapero, his lieutenant and the former heads of Catalonia's police and attorney-general's departments will stand trial in the National High Court (the direct continuation of the Franco-era Court of Public Order).\n\nThe charges they face range from rebellion and sedition to participation in a criminal organisation. These are usually reserved for cases involving terrorism and organised crime. They were laid against the Catalan police and department heads for allegedly allowing the referendum to take place via deliberate inaction, thus sabotaging Spanish National Police and Civil Guard efforts to stop it.\n\nThe penalties sought by the Spanish prosecutor-general are as high as 25 years jail, in the case of former Catalan vice president Oriol Junqueras, leader of the Republican Left of Catalonia (ERC).\n\nThe prosecution is also seeking 17 years jail for the president of the Catalan language and cultural association \u00d2mnium Cultural Jordi Cuixart, former president of the Catalan National Assembly (ANC) Jordi S\u00e0nchez and former speaker of the Catalan parliament that passed the law enabling the referendum Carme Forcadell.\n\nTrapero and the department heads face 11 years jail. The smallest penalty is reserved for members of the Catalan parliament's speakership board -- fines of between \u20ac24,000 and \u20ac30,000.\n\nAll defendents face disqualification from holding public office for the term of their sentences.\n\nHowever, these trials will take place at a time when the credibility of the Spanish justice system has never been so low.\n\nOn October 18, a panel of the Third Chamber of the Supreme Court, devoted to issues of administrative and commercial law, overturned a ruling of a Madrid lower court. This ruling had made the mortgage-holder, and not the lending institution, liable to pay the Spanish mortgage documentation fee (between 0.5% and 1.5% of the value of the mortgage).\n\nThe panel's in-principle ruling that the fee is a bank liability shocked the financial sector. It has been the beneficiary of more than \u20ac60 billion in public support since the 2008 financial crisis threatened to overwhelm it.\n\nNow the banks would be exposed to paying out \u20ac3.6 billion to borrowers who have taken out a mortgage in the past four years and up to \u20ac25.6 billion if the fee were to apply to mortgages contracted since 2003. On October 19, the share price of Spain's six big banks dropped.\n\nHowever, banker blood pressure was relieved on the very same day, when the chamber's chief judge Luis Mar\u00eda Di\u00e9z-Picazo Gim\u00e9nez suspended the application of the panel's ruling due to its \"enormous social and economic implications\". This was despite his having been informed of the ruling and accepting it.\n\nBut he had been tapped on the shoulder by the Supreme Court's chief justice, Carlos Lesmes, whose own shoulder had been tapped by the financial powers.\n\nDi\u00e9z-Picazo then convened a meeting of all Third Chamber judges to reconsider the ruling. This was unprecedented in Supreme Court history.\n\nOn October 25, Lesmes made a public apology for the situation that \"we haven't managed well\". But on November 6, he got the result he sought: the Third Chamber full bench brought down a 15-13 ruling that once again made bank clients liable for the documentation fee.\n\nReaction to this umpteenth gift to Spain's hated banks was explosive. The social networks fumed.\n\nJudges for Democracy, the most progressive of Spain's associations of magistrates and closest to the ruling Spanish Socialist Workers Party (PSOE), tweeted: \"We totally disagree with the way the Supreme Court has handled the question of mortgages and with the harm done to citizens and the justice system.\n\n\"We demand the immediate resignation of Lesmes and D\u00edaz Picado and we call on parliament to act in defence of consumers.\"\n\nPodemos and the United Left called a Madrid demonstration for November 10, with United Left leader Alberto Garz\u00f3n tweeting: \"The private banks are thieves, the main enemies of the democracies and responsible for pillaging our economies.\n\n\"Today, the Supreme Court majority takes their side, confirming that justice has a price and that the system is rotten and worn-out.\"\n\nSo virulent was public reaction that the PSOE government, straight after announcing its \"respect\" for the decision, was forced to move to calm the rising storm.\n\nOn November 7, Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez announced that his government would legislate to have the fee henceforward paid by the banks, even as lawyers for mortgage-holders said they would appeal the Supreme Court decision all the way to Europe.\n\nOn November 6, Spanish justice suffered a humiliation. That day, the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg ruled that Basque left pro-independence leader Arnaldo Otegi and four other defendants had not had a fair trial in the 2011 National High Court case against them. They had been charged with being members of terrorist organisation Basque Homeland and Freedom (ETA).\n\nAccording to the ECHR decision, \"the applicants' fears of a lack of impartiality had been objectively justified\".\n\nUniversity of Barcelona law professor David Bondia said of the ECHR ruling: \"It's a slap in the face for the National High Court, but also for the Supreme Court and the Constitutional Court, because they didn't bother to consider the issue of judicial impartiality.\"\n\nOn hearing of the decision, Otegi, leader of the left pro-independence force EH Bildu, said: \"Strasbourg has put on the agenda that there are courts in the Spanish state that are not impartial, that they are making up charges that are not based in reality and that they are capable of bringing down verdicts probably knowing that they are unfair.\"\n\nHe hoped the decision would make the Spanish Courts think twice about their legal crusade against the Catalan leaders.\n\nOtegi will now apply to have the ban on his standing for office lifted, opening the way for him to possibly stand in the 2019 European parliament elections.\n\nThese hammer blows to the credibility of the Spanish legal system have also taken place against a background of ongoing scandals. Recent revelations include attempts by former People's Party (PP) general secretary Dolores de Cospedal to use crooked former police commissioner Jos\u00e9 Manuel Villarejo to derail investigations into PP corruption.\n\nIt also includes Villarejo's own boast that he ran a ring of prostitutes to glean confidential information from senior government and legal figures.\n\nAnother revealing tidbit was a farewell letter from Lesmes to Juan Antonio Ram\u00edrez Sunyer, the examining magistrate of Barcelona's Court Number 13, who died on November 4. Lesmes expressed his admiration \"for the person capable of pursuing so tenaciously what he believes in and what constitutes his inspiration and goal -- service to Justice, to the State, to Spain\".\n\nThis was the chief justice's way of referring to Sunyer's work against the Catalan independence movement.\n\nSunyer, who secretly began intelligence-gathering against the pro-independence government of president Carles Puigdemont in April last year, was responsible for authorising numerous phone taps on Catalan politicians and social movement leaders. He also ordered 40 Civil Guard raids on Catalan government institutions and private companies suspected of collaborating in the referendum.\n\nYet, despite accumulating 15,000 pages of information through such operations, Sunyer admitted on October 8 that he was unable to charge any of his targets with either rebellion or sedition.\n\nThis was confirmation that the decision of the Supreme Court and the National High Court to issue such charges was entirely subjective and political. It comes from a long-held stance of leading Spanish jurists with no sympathy for the Catalan independence cause.\n\nIt was also reflected in the Spanish solicitor-general's recommendation to the Supreme Court to downgrade the charge of rebellion to that of sedition, and to seek a maximum penalty of 12 years jail.\n\nThis confirms that it all depends on the politics of those doing the accusing. For example, the far-right outfit Vox, which is the \"popular prosecution\" in the Supreme Court trial, has called for the Catalan leaders to be jailed for up to 74 years.\n\nThe real crime of the Catalan leaders was simply to do what they were elected to do -- negotiate a Scottish-style consultation with Madrid and, if this proved impossible, carry out their own referendum.\n\nWith the authority of the Spanish legal system now near zero, the conditions for turning the Catalans' looming trial into one of Spanish justice itself become more favourable.",

      "title": "The FA, by their own logic, should ban the poppy | JOE.ie",
      "body": "Law 4 of the English Football Associations rulebook reads: \"Equipment must not have any political, religious or personal slogans, statements or images. Players must not reveal undergarments that show political, religious, personal slogans, statements or images, or advertising other than the manufacturer's logo\".\n\nIt is a rule that has been enforced on several occasions throughout the history of the Premier League.\n\nPep Guardiola, for example, was fined \u00a320,000 last season for wearing a yellow ribbon in solidarity with the imprisoned leaders of the Catalan independence movement.\n\nIn March of 2017, video footage captured for all the world to see as the Spanish state victimised the Catalan people with grotesque acts of police brutality. Guardiola was forbidden from standing with his people in even this tiny way. The FA simply did not think it worth the risk of alienating the Spaniards, who would doubtlessly take issue with Pep's choice of lapel-decoration.\n\nIt is somewhat incongruous then, that players are permitted, nay, expected, to wear the November poppy -- a symbol of remembrance for British soldiers who have fallen in war. Wars are typically rather political affairs, by nature.\n\nAs in the case of James McClean, they are vilified, and abused, and threatened if they don't wear one.\n\nThe poppy is an explicit allusion to World War I, a war in which Britain and her allies beat back German expansionism. But the poppy is not solely for soldiers who died in either of the World Wars.\n\nIt should go without saying that not all of Britain's wars were virtuous. Not all of Britain's soldiers were virtuous. The reason that James McClean knows that so well and cannot help but speak on it is because his own community, in his own lifetime, has been at the barrel of a gun held by Her Majesty's Forces. The atrocities of the British Empire are not hidden from history, they are there for anyone to read up on. Sadly, they just aren't taught in English schools.\n\nMany soldiers have tragically died defending freedom, that's true. But speak to any Northern Ireland Catholic, or Indian, or Kenyan. You will soon learn that it is not so easy to stitch a poppy to your jersey and play on without a care. Or at least... it shouldn't be.\n\nWearing the poppy is a political statement because it does not sufficiently address England's actions in Ireland, or India, or Africa, or the Boer War, or the Falklands, or indeed Afghanistan and Iraq. It is a one-sized symbol that simply does not fit all. It is without nuance, and turns respect into a binary -- either you respect dead soldiers or you don't. That's dangerously reductive for something so sensitive.\n\nBut even if the FA were to pull the disingenuous card of saying that remembering soldiers and armies is not a political act -- it is surely a personal one. And personal statements are banned. Players can't put national flags on their boots, or their kids' names, or show off the face of a dead relative on a t-shirt beneath their jersey. So what makes the poppy any different? And it seems like more players are catching on.\n\nThere has been no opening of the floodgates by any means, but this time around, McClean has a high-profile comrade of sorts. Man United holding midfielder, and Premier League winner, Nemanja Matic is also refusing to wear the poppy, having apparently just learned of its meaning in the last couple of days.\n\nIt's worth making clear that Matic's reason is not quite like McClean's. Matic is Serbian, and it was Serbia itself that led an ethnic cleansing of its own throughout Yugoslavia in the 1990s under Slobidan Milosevic, Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic, targeting the Kosovar people, Bosnians, Albanians and more.\n\nNevertheless, Matic was just a child at the time, and he will not wear the poppy because of the traumatic memories he has of NATO bombing his country in 1999 in an attempt to halt the genocide. Hundreds of civilians were killed when NATO intervened against Serbia, and it is understandable that Matic would not want to venerate or remember such a dark period in his country's recent past.\n\nMatic and McClean are by no means the only English Football League players whose countries have been caught in conflict that involves the UK in one way or another. Indeed, the vast majority of foreign players in the United Kingdom come from countries who have been invaded by or fought against Britain at some point in time. Indeed, it stands to reason that the Premier League could be getting away with a lot simply because many of the players aren't fully educated on the topic.\n\nIn the wider world, the Brits are resting on the idea that the Germans were worse will let them away without any scrutiny. Much like with their lionisation of Winston Churchill. Nevertheless, their attempts to justify suspending their rules to allow for the poppy fall flat.\n\nLast year, FA Chief Martin Glenn caused uproar when he tried to explain why the poppy was fine.\n\n\"We have rewritten Law 4 of the game so that things like a poppy are OK but things that are going to be highly divisive are not,\" he said.\n\n\"That could be strong religious symbols, it could be the Star of David, it could the hammer and sickle, it could be a swastika, anything like Robert Mugabe on your shirt -- these are the things we don't want. Poppies are not political symbols\".\n\nLet's have it right. The above statement is so painfully stupid that it hurts to think about. That the Star of David or any religious symbol would be placed alongside the Nazi swastika should sicken any right-thinking person. Unsurprisingly, Glenn was forced to apologise for the above mess. Yet the faulty logic he was communicating is still what supports the rule.\n\nEssentially, what he is saying is that the poppy is not divisive. But James McClean says it is divisive. Nemanja Matic says it's divisive. To look at the crowds of rabid fans screaming at McClean over the weekend, one would be forgiven for thinking that not everybody is on the same page about the whole poppy thing.\n\nThe current philosophy around the poppy is rooted in the idea that something that British people traditionally approve of could not possibly be divisive to anybody else.\n\nWearing a poppy is a mark of respect. It is a mark of respect for fallen soldiers -- tools of the powerful, most of them too young to die, many of whom are to be honoured. Inextricably, it is a mark of respect for the military history of Great Britain, whose status is far more morally ambiguous.\n\nBy banning the poppy, the FA would allow for all players and fans to remember and respect history in their own way. As it stands, they do nothing but foster the very division they claim they're trying to avoid.",

      "title": "Albert Rivera sides with far-right in Altsasu",
      "body": "Last Sunday residents in Altsasu, a small town in Navarre, woke up to a massive police operation reminiscent of a time long gone. Spain's Guardia Civil and Navarre's regional police had secured the village's entry points and the square where a political rally called by Espa\u00f1a Ciudadana, the platform sponsored by Ciudadanos and Albert Rivera, was scheduled to be held. Rivera did not pick Altsasu randomly. Our readers will recall that six young men from Altsasu received prison sentences of nine to thirteen years following a bar brawl with off-duty guardia civil officers who were on a night out with their partners. Despite the Public Prosecutor's claim, the judges saw no grounds for a conviction for terrorism, but found them guilty of aggravated hate crimes instead. Needless to say, most people in Altsasu believe that the penalties are disproportionate and many events have been held in solidarity with the families. Therefore, it was expected that the Ciudadanos-sponsored rally would irk and bother the local population.\n\nTo make matters worse, though, far-right party Vox endorsed the rally and announced that their leader, Santiago Abascal, would attend. This presented Rivera and Ciudadanos with a golden opportunity to call it to avoid providing a platform for the far right. Instead, they decided to welcome them and went ahead with the rally as planned. That is how Abascal and his followers, bearing countless Spanish flags without a shield, turned up for a Ciudadanos political meeting amidst protests (even the local church bells rang in an attempt to drown out the speeches) and massive riot police presence.\n\nIndeed, Rivera got the soundbite on the news that he was after. But so did Vox. And, truth be told, both parties are like peas in a pod when it comes to their rhetoric, particularly on the subject of Catalonia. Besides, as if he were trying to keep up, PP leader Pablo Casado spoke from Andalusia to say that he had already been to Altsasu to show his support for the Guardia Civil months earlier and did not make as much fuss as Rivera. So as not to appear disinterested, Casado sent local PP representatives to Sunday's Altsasu event, which meant that all three political parties on the Spanish right were present at a rally for the first time. Altsasu mayor Javier Ollo rightly denounced that Ciudadanos were using his hometown as a \"hostage\" for their political confrontation strategy.\n\nIndeed, the competition between the PP, Ciudadanos and Vox to woo conservative voters has driven the former two to radicalisation and abandoning the political centre while taking onboard the more extremist policies. For instance, MP Alejandro Fern\u00e1ndez -- the likely new leader of the PP in Catalonia -- stated on Sunday that he would have had president Torra removed from office \"from the word go\" and argued for bringing back a longer, more rigorous period of direct rule in Catalonia. The trouble with choosing this sort of radical rhetoric is that there will always be someone whose rhetoric is even more radical; namely, Vox, who openly advocate scrapping devolved regional powers in Spain. For this reason the most dangerous aspect of the tension-based strategy endorsed by the PP and Ciudadanos is that it provides a platform for the most violent far right, it whitewashes their hate speech aimed at anyone who is different (immigrants, Catalan independence supporters), and it can truly end peaceful coexistence, not merely in Catalonia but in all of Spain.",

      "title": "Catalan separatists indicted for rebellion, facing jail for up to 25 years",
      "body": "Catalan separatists indicted for rebellion, facing jail for up to 25 years\n\nOn Friday, Spain's public prosecutor filed its written accusation against Catalan secessionist leaders in pre-trial detention for their role in the Catalan independence referendum last year and the unilateral independence declaration that followed.\n\nThe referendum was deemed illegal by the Popular Party central government in Madrid and utilized to carry out brutal state repression in Barcelona and throughout Catalonia.\n\nPublic prosecutors are seeking a 25-year prison term for former deputy, regional vice-premier and leader of Left Republicans of Catalonia (ERC) Oriol Junqueras and to bar him from holding public office for the next 25 years. Jordi S\u00e0nchez and Jordi Cuixart, former heads of the Catalan National Assembly and \u00d2mnium Cultural, face 17-year jail terms and a 17-year ban on holding public office, as does former Catalan Parliament Speaker Carme Forcadell. Former regional ministers Joaquim Forn, Dolors Bassa, Ra\u00fcl Romeva, Josep Rull and Jordi Turull, are facing 16 years in prison.\n\nThey are all charged with rebellion for using \"the necessary violence to ensure the criminal outcome sought\" -- organising an unauthorised secessionist referendum. The crime carries a 30-year maximum sentence. For the three former regional ministers not in pre-trial jail, Carles Mund\u00f3, Maritxell Borr\u00e1s and Santi Vila, the requested sentence has been dropped to seven years on embezzlement charges.\n\nIn a separate court case, the National Court is investigating four officials in charge of the Catalan police last year. Prosecutors announced they are asking for 11 years imprisonment for the former regional police chief, Josep Lluis Trapero.\n\nBoth trials are expected to begin in early 2019.\n\nDuring the Catalan crisis the real violence came from the Spanish state, which deployed 16,000 police who violently assaulted voters, including the elderly, with over 1,000 injured. It then proceeded to jail Catalan nationalist politicians in pre-trial detention and impose an unelected government on the region. At the height of the crisis, the PP central government threatened direct military intervention.\n\nLast year, 120 jurists, most openly hostile to the Catalan secessionist cause, signed a manifesto describing the rebellion and sedition charges as a legal fraud. The manifesto stated, \"Only if violating legal principles very seriously can it be affirmed that the accused, in view of the facts that have been attributed to them, could have carried out this crime, or that of conspiracy for rebellion that requires a joint agreement to carry it out with violence.\"\n\nCourts outside Spain have also rejected the charge of \"rebellion.\" Earlier this year, the German High Court in Schleswig-Holstein ruled that former Catalan regional premier Carles Puigdemont, who fled last year to avoid arrest, could not be extradited to Spain on the equivalent German charge. The court argued that \"violent clashes with the Civil Guards or the National Police did not reach a point where the constitutional order was under threat in Spain.\"\n\nA month later, a Belgian court ruled that the three Spanish European Arrest Warrants for three exiled former Catalan ministers, Meritxell Serret, Antoni Comin and Lluis Puig, were \"irregular.\" Since then, Spain's High Court has withdrawn all the European Arrest Warrants against the Catalan separatists who fled Spain to avoid more embarrassing rulings.\n\nJune saw the installation of a minority Socialist Party (PSOE)-led government, backed by the pseudo-left Podemos and the Catalan and Basque nationalist parties. However, though Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez has urged dialogue with the separatists to solve the crisis, repression against the Catalan leaders continues.\n\nOn the same day the Public Prosecutors office laid its charges against the secessionists, state attorneys, representing the S\u00e1nchez government, called for the defendants to be charged with sedition. This is a lesser charge for suspects accused of subverting the Spanish state or constitution, but still carries a 15-year sentence. This epitomizes the supposed \"progressive\" agenda of the PSOE -- holding political prisoners for 15 years instead of 30!\n\nIn addition, to placate rightist accusations that the government was \"appeasing\" the Catalan nationalists, Justice Minister Dolores Delgado stated, \"This is not an issue of gestures [towards the separatists]. It's a judicial and technical issue of applying the law in a professional manner.\"\n\nCatalan premier Quim Torra has accused S\u00e1nchez of missing \"a golden opportunity to remove the Catalan conflict from the courts and put it back in the political arena, which is where it belongs.\" He added that S\u00e1nchez had \"decided not to act, which amounts to complicity with repression.\"\n\nThe separatist parties have announced they will now not back the government's budget in the Spanish parliament. Without their support, the budget will fail to pass as it faces opposition from the right-wing parties, Citizens and the PP.\n\nThe political right, including the far-right VOX, is nevertheless mounting a political offensive, utilizing the PSOE's bankrupt posturing and refusal to mount any genuine defence of democratic rights to prepare its social base for a renewed offensive against the working class.\n\nAttacking the decision of S\u00e1nchez to drop the rebellion charges as treachery, PP leader Pablo Casado tweeted, \"Months ago S\u00e1nchez argued that the separatists committed a crime of rebellion. He now uses state law to do Catalan leader Torra a favour. A hostage of the coup leaders, he is too discredited to continue presiding over the government and must call elections.\"\n\nCitizens Secretary General Jos\u00e9 Manuel Villegas accused S\u00e1nchez of \"acting like the defence attorney for the coup plotters\" in an interview with radio station SER.\n\nEditorials of the main right-wing newspapers also attacked the government. El Mundo called for snap elections \"as soon as possible,\" stating that \"the serious institutional crisis opened by this irresponsible government threatens to undermine the credibility of the judicial power and weaken the action of the state in the face of the most serious attempt to destroy our democracy.\"\n\nFor El Espa\u00f1ol \"there is no doubt that the executive uses this criminal lawsuit as an element of barter and political marketing with the separatists ... though for the insatiable separatists, their gifts are never enough.\"\n\nFor ABC , \"The reaction of Catalan separatism to the indictments ... proves to the Prime Minister that the appeasement tactic is sterile against out-of-control separatist coup plotters.\"\n\nThe pseudo-left party, Podemos, has, as could be expected, registered a polite complaint at the PSOE's continued prosecution of the separatist leaders, while making clear this will not cut across their collusion with Sanchez.\n\nGeneral Secretary Pablo Iglesias stated that \"those of us who defend dialogue have to continue to work for a political solution and put an end to the judicialisation of the conflict. It's difficult, but it's possible and we have to continue this path.\" He carefully omitted any mention of the PSOE governments' state attorney's sedition charges.\n\nThe following day, Iglesias made clear that his main concern is the fate of the PSOE government. He framed his remarks as a defence of the government's budget, which includes a handful of social reforms within a framework of continued austerity that are so minimal they have even been approved by the European Union. He attacked the secessionists for announcing they would not support the budget, asking, \"Why do working people have to pay for the authoritarianism of the PP and the lack of courage of the PSOE?\"\n\nThis pose of concern for workers is a fraud. Sanchez made clear, at an event organised by Reuters September 27, that he is ready to abandon his plans for a minimal increase in spending and abide by the deficit targets set previously by the PP if this avoids a snap general election. \"If we are obliged to present a draft with the former commitments we will do it,\" he said.\n\nIglesias is declaring his loyalty to the PSOE to further plans for a place for Podemos in a coalition government following an increasingly likely snap election. In the process he is making clear his party's readiness to help implement continued state repression and austerity.",

      "body": "MADRID - Spain's public prosecutor filed on Friday a rebellion charge against Catalan leaders who were being held in pretrial detention for their alleged roles in a banned independence referendum last year.\n\nIn its formal accusation, the prosecutor was seeking sentences of between 16-25 years for the jailed politicians, with the highest sentence being sought for the vice president of the since defunct Catalan government, Oriol Junqueras.\n\nNine politicians from the wealthy region in northeastern Spain have been held in custody since the Catalan independence bid last October.\n\nMeanwhile, the deposed president of the Catalan government, Carles Puigdemont, was in self-imposed exile in Belgium.\n\nBesides a jail term of 25 years being sought for Junqueras, the prosecutor was requesting 16 years for five former cabinet members and 17 years for the former heads of civic associations Jordi Sanchez and Jordi Cuixart as well as the former speaker of the Catalan parliament, Carme Forcadell.\n\nSpain's Solicitor General, which represents the state, meanwhile filed charges of sedition and misuse of public funds against the Catalan politicians.\n\nIt asked for a 12-year sentence for Junqueras, 11 and a half for five former ministers, 10 years of Forcadell and eight years for Sanchez and Cuixart.\n\nRebellion is punishable by between 15-30 years under Spanish law, while sedition carries sentences of between 10-15 years.\n\nFollowing the Catalan government's unilateral declaration of independence, the Spanish government under then Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy activated Article 155 of the Constitution, which restricted Catalonia's regional autonomy, dissolved regional institutions and temporarily brought them under Madrid's direct rule.",

      "body": "Catalan regional president Quim Torra speaks to the press at the Catalan regional parliament's auditorium in Barcelona\n\nSpanish prosecutors called Friday for Catalan separatist leaders to be jailed for up to 25 years on charges of rebellion or misuse of public funds over last year's failed secession bid.\n\nIn a statement ahead of an upcoming Supreme Court trial, the prosecution service said it was seeking prison sentences against 12 Catalan leaders ranging from seven to 25 years, the latter jail term being sought for former Catalan vice-president Oriol Junqueras.\n\nBut in a sign Spain's socialist government disagreed, the attorney general's office announced it would ask for just 12 years jail for Junqueras, accusing him of sedition and misuse of public funds rather than the more serious charge of rebellion.\n\nThe sensitive trial is expected to start in early 2019 -- more than a year after Catalan leaders attempted to break from Spain in October 2017 by staging a referendum despite a court ban and subsequently proclaiming independence.\n\nSpain's then conservative government moved swiftly to depose the Catalan executive, dissolve the regional parliament and call snap local elections in December.\n\nSome Catalan leaders such as deposed regional president Carles Puigdemont fled abroad, while others like Junqueras remained and were put into custody pending the trial.\n\nApart from Junqueras, prosecutors want two influential Catalan civic leaders, Jordi Sanchez and Jordi Cuixart, and former regional parliamentary speaker Carme Forcadell jailed for 17 years.\n\nIn a separate case, prosecutors said they were seeking four to 11 years jail against former regional police leaders including Catalonia's then police chief Josep Lluis Trapero, who is also accused of rebellion.\n\nCatalonia's current separatist leader Quim Torra reacted angrily against the jail terms sought for \"good people, peaceful people.\"\n\n\"Does anyone think that the two million independence supporters will just disappear by demanding (a total of) 200 years of jail for pro-independence leaders?\" he asked.\n\n'Intimidating force'\n\nIn its statement, the prosecution service said pro-independence leaders had planned to use all possible means to achieve secession, \"including -- knowing that the state wouldn't accept this situation -- any violence needed to secure this criminal result\".\n\nIt said separatist leaders had instigated \"big citizen mobilisations\" that represented an \"intimidating force\" and had also used the regional police force of 17,000 agents, who followed their orders.\n\nThe charge of rebellion has caused controversy in Spain, not just among those who support Catalan independence but further afield among legal experts.\n\nAccording to Spanish law, rebellion is \"rising up in a violent and public manner,\" to among other things \"breach, suspend or change the constitution\" or \"declare independence for part of the (Spanish) territory\".\n\nMilitary officers behind a 1981 attempted coup in Spain were found guilty of rebellion, for instance.\n\nBut many legal experts contest the use of rebellion in the Catalan case, saying there was no violence during the secession bid, bar that waged by Spanish police on October 1, 2017 as they tried to stop people from voting in the banned referendum.\n\nSpain's justice minister acknowledged the controversy on Friday, telling reporters there was a \"legal, even social debate on what happened in Catalonia in September and October last year\".\n\n\"This debate also took place at the attorney general's office,\" Dolores Delgado said, pointing out that it had decided to press charges of sedition, misuse of public funds and disobedience against Catalan leaders, and not rebellion.\n\nShe denied it was a political decision on the part of the Socialist government, which is in a minority in parliament and depends on other lawmakers, including from Catalan separatist parties, to pass bills or approve the budget.",

      "title": "Catalan independence leaders could face up to 25 years in jail",
      "body": "Spanish prosecutors have called for prison sentences of up to 25 years for those accused of leading last year's failed Catalan independence bid, amid opposition claims that the government has tried to influence the judiciary.\n\nThe attorney general said the supreme court should try former Catalan vice-president Oriol Junqueras, six other politicians and two rank-and-file leaders for rebellion for their role in an outlawed referendum held in October 2017, which was followed by a declaration of independence.\n\nMr Junqueras, who has been in jail since, faces a possible 25-year prison sentence and could be barred from public office for up to 25 years if found guilty. He is also accused of misuse of public funds. Former Catalan parliamentary speaker Carme Forcadell and rank-and-file leaders Jordi Cuixart and Jordi S\u00e0nchez, who are all accused of rebellion and are also in custody, could face jail sentences of up to 17 years.\n\nFive former ministers in the Catalan government face jail terms of up to 16 years for rebellion and misuse of public funds, while another nine defendants face lesser charges.\n\nMeanwhile, former Catalan police chief Josep Llu\u00eds Trapero, who will be tried separately along with three others by the high court, could face a jail sentence of up to 11 years if found guilty of rebellion.\n\nHowever, there was controversy when equivalent charges presented by the state lawyer's office, which works in conjunction with the justice ministry, were noticeably more lenient. The state lawyer did not call for any of the defendants to be tried for the most serious charge of rebellion, asking for a 12-year sentence for Mr Junqueras for sedition and misuse of public funds.\n\nThe rebellion charge is particularly controversial as it implies that violence or the threat of it was used, something the independence movement insists was not the case.\n\nNonetheless, the state lawyer's position drew an angry response from the Catalan government. The region's president, Quim Torra, said that Madrid had \"missed an opportunity to take the judicial dimension out of a conflict that is political\".\n\nMeanwhile, unionist opposition parties claim that Socialist prime minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez has been pressuring the judiciary to soften its case against the independence leaders because he needs the parliamentary support of Catalan nationalists. The state lawyer's refusal to use the rebellion charge therefore drew strong criticism.\n\nPablo Casado, leader of the conservative Popular Party, tweeted that it was \"indecent that the government humiliates Spain by forcing the state lawyer to distance itself from the attorney general and not accuse the coup-mongers of rebellion\".\n\nJustice minister Dolores Delgado denied that the government had influenced the position of the state lawyer's office, which, she said, was based on \"technical, professional and judicial criteria\".\n\nThe trial is expected to begin early next year.\n\nSeveral others accused of involvement in last year's referendum who are not in the country, such as former Catalan president Carles Puigdemont, are not facing charges because they cannot be tried in their absence.",

      "title": "Spain charges Catalan leaders",
      "body": "MADRID -- Spain's criminal case against Catalan leaders over the region's independence push reached the next stage Friday -- but two Spanish legal bodies have different ideas about what charges they should face.\n\nThe state prosecutor's office -- Fiscal\u00eda -- accused the most senior officials, including former Catalan Vice President Oriol Junqueras, of rebellion and misuse of public funds, and demanded they be jailed for up to 25 years.\n\nHowever, the state attorney -- Abogac\u00eda del Estado - which represents the government in the proceedings, accused Junqueras and others of the lesser charge of sedition, as well as misuse of public funds, and demanded up to 12 years in prison.\n\nBoth rebellion and sedition are described in the Spanish penal code as uprisings against constitutional order, but while the former implies the use of violent means, the latter does not.\n\nIt will be up to the country's Supreme Court to decide which of those charges -- if any -- the Catalan leaders will be convicted of. The court hasn't yet set an official date for the start of the trial, but it's expected to begin early next year.\n\nEighteen lawmakers, civic leaders and members of the former Catalan government will appear before the Supreme Court charged with orchestrating the events of October 2017, which saw an unconstitutional referendum and a declaration of independence in the northeastern region. Former regional president Carles Puigdemont and others who fled the country are not in the 18 as Spanish law prohibits charges being brought in absentia.\n\nThis trial is unlikely to make a difference to Spain's efforts to bring back Puigdemont to face the courts.\n\nThe Catalan independence push provoked the gravest political crisis in Spain's 40-year-old democracy and every detail of the judicial proceedings has become highly controversial. Catalan independence supporters accuse Madrid of being authoritarian and unfairly repressing their leaders but many opponents of the Socialist government claim Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez is bowing to the separatists by ordering the state's attorney to accuse them of a more lenient charge.\n\n\"We don't tolerate that S\u00e1nchez jeopardizes Spain's dignity on a mandate from the putschists,\" tweeted Pablo Casado, leader of the conservative Popular Party.\n\nAlbert Rivera, leader of the liberal Ciudadanos, said on Twitter that S\u00e1nchez \"is using the executive power to benefit those who staged a coup against our democracy.\"\n\nThe Spanish judiciary is independent from the government and the Spanish government has been at pains to say it isn't exerting any pressure on the legal system.\n\nJustice Minister Dolores Delgado denied that the state attorney's position was a government gesture to Catalan pro-independence parties, telling reporters on Friday that public servants had acted according to their own \"criteria.\"\n\nCatalan President Quim Torra said on social media the charges were \"indecent,\" adding: \"They are thirsty for vengeance and not for justice. Voting is not a crime. And we will not stop until they [the indicted] are free and at home.\"\n\nThe public prosecutor on Friday also issued charges against former Catalan police chief Josep Llu\u00eds Trapero and three other local officials, also charged with rebellion or sedition.",

      "body": "Spanish prosecutors have called for Catalan pro-independence leaders to face as much as 25 years in prison on charges, including rebellion, for their role in organising a breakaway from Spain last year.\n\nA formal indictment was handed down on Friday by the public prosecutor against 22 people involved in the independence push last October, which caused the greatest constitutional crisis Spain has faced in its recent democratic history.\n\nOf those accused, 11 people, including the former deputy Catalan leader Oriol Junqueras, will face the highest charge of rebellion, a charge reserved for those who \"rise violently and publicly\" against the government or the country's constitution.\n\nBut in a sign of the controversy surrounding the case, the state's attorney-general that represents the Madrid government called for rebellion charges to be dropped against the 11 in favour of the lesser charge of sedition, which is subverting the state without violence.\n\nThere is fierce debate n Spain about whether the overwhelmingly peaceful independence push, which led to an informal referendum and then a declaration of independence, could be considered violent.\n\nThe minority socialist government of Pedro Sanchez is also acutely aware that the trials of the Catalan leaders, which are set to start early next year, threatens to shatter the fragile peace between Madrid and Barcelona in recent months.\n\nThe pro-independence Catalan government has made the freeing of their former leaders a central part of its political agenda. A harsh sentence could cause a fresh rise in tensions and lead to a renewed push for Catalan independence.\n\nCatalan pro-independence politicians and civil society groups responded angrily to the rebellion charges on Friday, warning that there would be repercussions.\n\nErnest Maragall, the Catalan minister for foreign affairs, said on Twitter that the Spanish state had broken \"all hope of rectification and reconciliation\" by handing out these charges. \"Catalans: prepare for a winter of repression & injustice,\" he wrote.\n\nMarcel Mauri, vice-leader of \u00d2mnium Cultural, the grassroots pro-independence campaign group, said: \"Today the State has decided to bring democracy to trial, the Spanish government has given in to the blackmail of the extreme right.\"\n\nRelations between Barcelona and Madrid matter in particular for Mr Sanchez, whose government relies on the political support of the pro-independence Catalan parties to pass new acts of parliament. Mr Sanchez is currently banking on their support to pass his 2019 budget.\n\nDolores Delgado, Spain's minister of justice, said on Friday that the question of whether the charges should be rebellion or sedition was not a political one, but a \"technical-judicial\" one. \"It is not about gestures, but has been done by the professionals of the state attorneys.\"\n\nCarles Puigdemont, Catalonia's former leader who was central to the independence drive, is not one of those who will face trial because he is living in self-imposed exile in Belgium and Spain does not allow trials in absentia.\n\nSeparately on Friday, four more officials who were in charge of the regional police last year were indicted, with prosecutors calling for 11 years of imprisonment for the former regional police chief, Josep Lluis Trapero.",

      "body": "Spanish prosecutors have called former Catalan vice-president Oriol Junqueras to be imprisoned for 25 years on charges of rebellion and misuse of public funds, the highest prison term being sought for separatist leaders who pushed for Catalan independence last year.\n\nThe formal indictment issued on Friday by Spain's Public Prosecutor accuses 22 people of varying degrees of involvement in organising the push to break away from Spain, including holding a banned referendum.\n\nJunqueras was accused as the main promoter with 11 other politicians, activists and civil servants also charged with rebellion for using \"the necessary violence to ensure the criminal outcome sought\".\n\nThe banned vote in the northeastern region caused Spain's gravest political crisis in four decades, prompting an unprecedented four-month-long suspension of Catalonia's government.\n\nOne year later, most of those involved have either been indicted or fled the country. A new Catalan separatist administration has kept up a defiant pro-independence rhetoric but has not broken the law.\n\nIn October, Spain's Supreme Court wrapped up the probe into 18 politicians and activists for their links to the turbulent events.\n\nFour more officials who were in charge of the regional police are being investigated in the country's National Court and were also indicted on Friday, with prosecutors calling for 11 years imprisonment for former regional police chief Josep Lluis Trapero.\n\nColour revolution: Spanish police battle paint-throwing Catalan separatists in Barcelona\n\nBoth trials are expected to begin in early 2019.\n\nFriday's highly expected indictment did not involve the Catalan politicians who fled the country, including former regional president Carles Puigdemont, who now lives in Belgium and Spain is considered a fugitive.\n\nJunqueras, who stayed in Spain and was jailed preventively exactly one year ago, could also face a ban from holding public office for the next 25 years if the judges agree during the upcoming trial.\n\nThe second-highest prison terms in the indictments - 17 years - were for Jordi Cuixart and Jordi Sanchez, activists who at the time headed two civil society groups pushing for Catalan independence, and also for Carme Forcadell, who was the Catalan parliament's speaker.\n\nPolice vs firefighters: officers clash in defining images of Catalonia referendum\n\nWeeks after the banned referendum went ahead amid violence against voters when police tried to stop it, Forcadell presided over a tense house session where a narrow separatist majority of lawmakers passed an independence declaration.\n\nThe declaration did not have any immediate effect and instead prompted central authorities to move swiftly to take over control of Catalonia.\n\nUnder the Spanish criminal code, rebellion punishes with prison terms ranging from 15 to 30 years to those who \"rise violently and publicly'\" against the government or the country's constitution.\n\nIn a separate indictment on Friday, state lawyers representing the central government called for the case to be tried as the lesser charge of sedition, which doesn't involve violence and can be punished with a maximum of 15 years in prison.\n\n'They can't put us all in prison': violent protests erupt in Catalonia after arrest of separatist leaders\n\nThe different criteria between the public prosecutor and the state lawyers could have limited effect in the trial. But the fact that the latter has dropped the rebellion charge is seen as a sign of how the centre-left government of Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez needs support in parliament from separatist parties to pass the national budget and remain in power.",

A number of other Catalan politicians have either been indicted or have also left the country.\n\nThe Catalan independence bid was Spain's worst political crisis in the four decades since the end of the Franco dictatorship.\n\ntj\/msh (dpa, Reuters, AP)",

      "body": "(ANSAmed) - MADRID, NOVEMBER 2 - The Spanish prosecutor's office on Friday called for a 25-year prison sentence for the leader of the pro-independence Catalan party Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya (ErC), Oriol Junqueras, for a challenge to the central government that ended in the unilateral declaration of independence on October 27, 2017.\n\nHe has been charged with the crime of \"rebellion\". After a year of investigations, the prosecutor on Friday presented the request for sentences, ranging from 25 years for former Catalan vice president Junqueras, to 16 for five former \"advisors\": Jordi Turull, Raul Romeva, Joaquim Forn, Dolors Bassa and Josep Rull.\n\nFor the leaders of Omnium Cultural and the Catalan National Assembly, Jordi Cuixart and Jordi Sanchez, the prosecution asked for 17 years in jail and a 17-year ban on holding public office, as it did for former Catalan Parliament Speaker Carme Forcadell.\n\nAll are charged with \"rebellion\", a crime that carries a 30-year maximum sentence. For the three advisors not in detention - Carles Mund\u00f3, Maritxell Borr\u00e1s and Santiago Vila - the requested sentence dropped to 7 years, since they are accused only of embezzlement.\n\nIn providing motivations for the requested sentences, the prosecutor said that those charged were behind a planned strategy to achieve Catalonian independence as a new state in the form of a republic and separate it from Spain through synchronized actions at the parliamentary, executive and social levels.

Its head Quim Torra will address the media on Friday afternoon.\n\nThe leaders' defence team must present its case in the next few weeks and the trial is expected to begin in January.\n\nThe prosecutor is also seeking up to 11 years in prison for four others, including the head of the Catalan police at the time of the independence declaration, in a separate High Court case.\n\n(Reporting by Paul Day; Editing by Andres Gonzalez and John Stonestreet)",

      "body": "Spanish prosecutors called Friday for Catalan separatist leaders to be jailed for up to 25 years on charges of rebellion or misuse of public funds over last year's failed secession bid.\n\nIn a statement ahead of an upcoming Supreme Court trial, the prosecution service said it was seeking prison sentences against 12 Catalan leaders ranging from seven to 25 years, the latter jail term being sought for former Catalan vice-president Oriol Junqueras.\n\nBut in a sign Spain's socialist government disagreed, the attorney general's office announced it would ask for just 12 years jail for Junqueras, accusing him of sedition and misuse of public funds rather than the more serious charge of rebellion.\n\nThe sensitive trial is expected to start in early 2019 -- more than a year after Catalan leaders attempted to break from Spain in October 2017 by staging a referendum despite a court ban and subsequently proclaiming independence.\n\nSpain's then conservative government moved swiftly to depose the Catalan executive, dissolve the regional parliament and call snap local elections in December.\n\nSome Catalan leaders like deposed regional president Carles Puigdemont fled abroad, while others like Junqueras remained and were put into custody pending the trial.\n\nApart from Junqueras, prosecutors want two influential Catalan civic leaders, Jordi Sanchez and Jordi Cuixart, and former regional parliamentary speaker Carme Forcadell jailed for 17 years.\n\nIn a separate case, they said they were also seeking four to 11 years jail against former regional police leaders including Catalonia's then police chief Josep Lluis Trapero, whom they also accuse of rebellion.\n\nIn its statement, the prosecution service said pro-independence leaders planned to use all possible means to achieve secession, \"including -- knowing that the state wouldn't accept this situation -- any violence needed to secure this criminal result.\"\n\n- 'Intimidating force' -\n\nIt said separatist leaders had instigated \"big citizen mobilisations\" that represented an \"intimidating force\" and had also used the regional police force, with its 17,000 agents, which followed their orders.\n\nThe charge of rebellion has caused controversy in Spain, not just among those who support Catalan independence but further afield among legal experts.\n\nAccording to Spanish law, rebellion is \"rising up in a violent and public manner,\" to among other things \"breach, suspend or change the constitution\" or \"declare independence for part of the (Spanish) territory\".\n\nMilitary officers behind a 1981 attempted coup in Spain were found guilty of rebellion, for instance.\n\nBut many legal experts contest the use of rebellion in the Catalan case, saying there was no violence during the secession bid, bar that waged by Spanish police on October 1, 2017 as they tried to stop people from voting in the banned referendum.",

      "body": "By dropping the 'rebellion' charges against the figureheads of last year's botched independence attempt in Catalonia, Spain's State attorney has angered a large sector of society. So what's all the fuss about if other serious charges still stand?\n\nSpain's Abogac\u00eda del Estado announced late on Thursday that the detained or exiled Catalan politicians behind last year's failed breakup with Spain won't face high treason charges in Madrid's Supreme Court.\n\nAccording to the State bar, their actions didn't constitute what's referred to in the Spanish Penal Code as 'rebeli\u00f3n' (rebellion or treason), primarily due to an alleged lack of proof of violent means during their October 2017 coup attempt.\n\nInstead the charge has been reduced to sedition, also a conduct or language inciting rebellion against the authority of a state, but one without violence.\n\nThe reason why this is big news in the Spanish press is the difference in prison sentences. Those found guilty of high treason face 30 years behind bars whereas for sedition jail time is up to 15 years.\n\nLast year's attempted independence coup by numerous Catalan officials and their separatist followers polarized the region and Spain as a whole.\n\nThere were incidents of violence during demonstrations in Barcelona and across Catalonia, but it was Spain's National Police force that received the worst condemnation for their aggressive conduct.\n\nNonetheless, nationalists and the country's former ruling Popular Party are unlikely to accept the sedition charge as sufficient, hoping instead for the harshest possible sentence to send out a clear message to those vying for another independence push in Catalonia.\n\nThat's despite the fact that on Friday the prosecution service said it was seeking prison sentences against 12 Catalan leaders of up to 25 years, including Oriol Junqueras. Spain's conservatives are still calling for more.\n\n\"Months ago S\u00e1nchez argued that the separatists committed a crime of rebellion,\" opposition PP leader Pablo Casado tweeted, a staunch nationalist with the same hardline approach to Catalan separatism as his predecessor Mariano Rajoy.\n\n\"He now uses state law to do Catalan leader Torra a favour. A hostage of the coup leaders, he is too discredited to continue presiding over the government and must call elections.\"\n\nSpanish conservative daily El Mundo went with the headline \"Pedro S\u00e1nchez hands himself in to the coup leaders\", accusing the current Prime Minister of pandering to Catalan separatist parties, who he does in fact need to pass legislation in the Spanish Parliament, particularly with current national budget negotiations underway.\n\nThe Socialists do however refuse to allow any future referendum on self-determination, much like their conservative predecessors.\n\nSpain's public prosecutors office has also reacted to the news by reaffirming its belief that the high treason charge should stand for Catalan officials such as Artur Mas and Oriol Junqueras.\n\nIt's worth noting as well that many of the \"proc\u00e9s\" leaders still stand accused of the embezzlement of \u20ac3.2 million of public funds, punishable by sentences of up to 12 years in Spain when the amount embezzled is above \u20ac250,000.\n\nDespite this, thousands of their separatist supporters went to Lledoners prison in Catalonia on Wednesday to demand the immediate release of their imprisoned politicians.",

      "title": "El Clasico: Barcelona the lifeblood of the Catalonia region",
      "body": "El Clasico is the biggest game in world football. This is not a subjective statement either -- there is simply nothing compared to it in terms of impact and feeling, significance and consequence. Millions the world over watch Barcelona and Real Madrid battle for, not just footballing superiority, but the very soul of a nation.\n\nI was part of a group of 15 journalists invited by La Liga to witness the first Clasico of the season, and we were given an insight into the passion with which football is lived in Spain.\n\nThat these are the two biggest teams in the world means the stakes are remarkably high, and so following Barcelona's rampant display and humiliating 5-1 defeat of their arch rivals this past weekend, it came as no surprise at all that Real Madrid moved to dismiss their manager, Julen Lopetegui.\n\nFor the Catalan giants, it was another huge blow to Spanish nationalism. It is on the pitch, in lieu of in the political structure, that their yearning for Catalan independence finds expression.\n\nThe atmosphere inside Camp Nou - Barcelona's sprawling edifice which there are plans afoot to refurbish and expand, from its current 99,354 capacity to 105,000 -- was charged with sentiment, some of which boiled over into abuse of Madrid's captain Sergio Ramos.\n\nOutside it though, in the aftermath of the victory, fans from the region, and from all around the world, celebrated the triumph like they would a major trophy. For them, it was more than just one game.\n\nIt transcends just 90 minutes for La Liga, being the league's flagship season after season. As the dominance of both teams has grown, the scale of the Clasico has risen also. Both sides line up internationals from all over the world -- no fewer than 10 nationalities were represented on Sunday - a command loyalty and followership to an ever-increasing degree. La Liga also leverages on it for all its worth.\n\nThe trip also gave us the opportunity to understand the core values and working mechanisms of clubs like RCD Espanyol, FC Barcelona, and Girona FC.\n\nAs Barcelona upholds the banner for continued Catalan defiance, they cast a very large shadow. The more modest duo of Espanyol and Girona inhabit this shadow, and they have, in rather novel fashion, opted to forge their own path to stay relevant in the region.\n\nEspanyol's unique philosophy is to build toward an entirely home-grown team in a few years. In their minds, it is practically impossible to get close to their big city rivals, either in terms of clout or success, and so this is their victory. Barcelona has the renowned La Masia, of course, as well as the very top of the line in training facilities, but lately, youngsters have found their path to the first team blocked due to the global appeal of the club.\n\nIt is hard to see a way into the team when the first team can shell out the sort of sum it did to bring in Ousmane Dembele before he had even turned 21.\n\n\"When the young players see multimillion euros signings like Dembele and Coutinho it makes them feel a little upset,\" admits Sergio Vallecillo, Head of Methodology at La Masia.\n\n\"But it also serves as motivation for them to do better and not feel discouraged.\n\n\"La Masia is home to the best young players raised in the philosophy of the biggest club in the world,\" Juan Jos\u00e9 Luque, Director of Residence La Mas\u00eda added.\n\nThis is the chink in their armour, the avenue by which Espanyol could upstage the Bar\u00e7a juggernaut.\n\nGirona, on their part, is reaping the reward of a partnership with Manchester City. This has seen them acquire talented prospects from the English side, as well as enjoy the residual visibility that comes with being associated with them. It entails a lot of loan deals, meaning the club can often seem like a layover rather than a harbour. That, however, is a small price to pay for quality and a level of competitiveness that their modest resources would ordinarily be unable to provide.\n\nSo, it is very much a complex ecosystem of varying approaches and interests, all of which have found a means of coexisting.\n\nBarcelona, the lifeblood of the region and, by virtue of its sheer size, the major income earner; Espanyol seeking to win the hearts of the local population; Girona seeking ingenious ways to compete.",

      "body": "General prospects for Spaniards are not promising, and, in many cases, worse than in 2011. So in what sense can it be said that after 15M, mentalities have changed?\n\nThe openMovements series invites leading social scientists to share their research results and perspectives on contemporary social struggles.\n\nJuventud Sin Futuro,15M. Madrid, May 15, 2011. Flickr\/Daniele Grasso. Some rights reserved.\n\nIt has been almost a decade since, following a large demonstration organized by the Youth Without a Future collective (Juventud Sin Futuro), on May 15, 2011, a small group of people decided to camp at the Puerta del Sol in Madrid.\n\nThe lack of political alternatives to the impending municipal elections, which would sweep the Popular Party (Partido Popular) to power; the first major social cuts initiated by Zapatero's socialist government and the devastating effects of an economic crisis that had lasted for 4 years and which painted a grim prospect; were the fundamental reasons for the articulation of a series of mobilizations that would change the Spanish political and social panorama. The facts are well known: almost a month of camping, demonstrations in more than 60 Spanish cities, more than a million people in the streets, more than 500 assemblies around the world and a series of parallel and sister mobilizations, such as the different occupy movements. Traditional policy did not fulfil the aspirations, needs and demands of an important part of the general public and thus 15M was born, internationally known as the Indignados Movement (anti-austerity movement).\n\nShortly after this expression of social dissatisfaction, these mobilizations, resulted in the birth of political formations, among which Podemos stood out when 4 years after 15M, the party which was a coalition with other new formations, managed to gain access to government in several Spanish cities, besides acquiring a remarkable relevance and political representation in almost all of Spain's regions and at the state-level.\n\nAlthough 15M continues to exist as a residual social movement, with several active assemblies and a certain presence in the virtual world, the birth of these new political formations and their rapid process of institutionalization has overtaken their main demands and channels of action. In this sense, and despite the speed of the whole process, we could ask ourselves if 15M's foundational and articulating objectives have been achieved or not, and if so at least to what extent. If we can show some relevant after-effects, are these positive or negative ? Some continuities and other political and social transformations may be discerned, but their impact may well take some time to materialize.\n\nFrom the point of view of the great demands in the macrosocial field, the one true thing is that the general prospects for Spaniards are not especially promising, and, in many cases, worse than in 2011. According to Labour Force Surveys, although unemployment figures have eased for all age groups, reaching around 16% by the end of 2018, youth unemployment continues being structural, with dramatic data for young people between 16 and 19 years at above 50%, as well as for those from 20 to 24 years old being above 30%, and for those from 25 to 29 years old at above 20%. Moreover, we need to add precarity into the picture since more than 90% of the contracts signed in 2018 were temporary, the highest figure in the European Union.\n\nAccording to the latest Living Conditions Survey from the National Institute of Statistics, 22.3% of the Spanish population is below the poverty line and 31.3% of children in Spain are at risk of poverty or social exclusion. The differences between rich and poor in Spain have increased markedly, placing us third as the country with the greatest inequalities in the EU. While 70% of the population has seen their economic situation worsen since before the crisis began, during that same period the number of millionaires has tripled, showing that data on economic recovery has only affected people with high incomes[1].\n\nThe housing problem persists, in addition to the more than 700,000 families who have lost their homes since 2007 (more than 300,000 since 2011). The price of rent and property has increased, reaching figures similar to those before the real estate bubble's explosion[2]. The increase in house prices, which could be analyzed as a clear macroeconomic indicator of an exit from economic crisis, is again an indicator, however, that this exit has not benefited the society's most vulnerable strata, such as young people. Young people's 'emancipation age' - that is the age at which they leave their parental home to live on their own - has gone up in recent years. According to data from the Observatory of Emancipation in 2017, less than two out of every ten young people in Spain leave their parents' house to live on their own, the lowest data since 2002. A young person must allocate 57.9% of their salary to be able to acquire a property and must earn 4.1 times their salary to cover the amount needed for a down-payment on a house in trade-in value. If a young person chooses to rent, they would need 69.3% of their salary to meet the monthly amount.\n\nThe university, public education and the public health system have not recovered to their pre-crisis levels. They continue to cut their budgets, and the same is done to scholarships and other benefits, while, for example university fees increase.\n\nFinally, and taking into account GDP, it is true that since 2014 (the first year in which GDP has risen since 2008, by 1.4%), Spain has grown, but since 2015 when it had reached 3.5% it has produced a slight but steady decrease, around 1%, accompanied by a scandalous and worrying increase in public debt, almost 100% of GDP, 30% more than in 2011 and 70% more than at the beginning of the crisis[3].\n\nIf macroeconomic data does not show a palpable dent in the neoliberal model, from the point of view of liberties, democracy and dignity, the situation is not promising either.\n\nIn 2015, the Popular Party approved the so-called Gag Law (La Ley Mordaza), as a direct response to mobilizations that demanded political responsibility for corruption and that encouraged democratic change. This law established new crimes of information, assembly and demonstration, undermining freedom of expression with the scandalous arrests of activists, artists and journalists.\n\nThe sentences meted out for the glorification of terrorism, many due to simple jokes on social networks, have increased four-fold since 2011[4], the year in which ETA also announced its permanent cessation of violence. There are also arrests, convictions and imprisonments for insults to the Crown, offending religious feelings and even for making jokes about Franco. On the other hand, Catalonia's independence process, which was dealt with by both government and police by deploying an unusual amount of violence, has led to the imprisonment without bail of several Catalan politicians who are awaiting trial.\n\nAt the same time corruption, which is already endemic and structural in Spain, and which costs Spanish taxpayers about 100,000 million euros a year[5] - one of the fuses that ignited 15M and the birth of the new parties - has entailed few repercussions for the traditional parties.\n\nIt is true that there have been a good number of politicians who have been convicted and imprisoned, several ministers, autonomous presidents, deputies and mayors. The Popular Party is even the first political party to have been condemned for corruption in Spanish history. But the electoral prospects of the leading parties have not been seriously affected.\n\nIt is important to remember that the Popular Party has won all the general elections and in almost all Spanish communities and cities since 15M emerged, and that by contrast the vast majority of progressive governments have arisen through pacts between the Socialist Party and Podemos or their allies. There does not seem to have been an impact on the general public concordant to the size and magnitude of the crimes of corruption committed, especially in the regions most affected by these crimes.\n\nThe truth is that the concept of democracy, the defense of social rights, freedom, equality and the spirit of coexistence are not going through their finest moment in Spain right now. The process of Catalan independence has revived the most rancid nationalist Spanish feelings; awakening xenophobic attitudes on both sides, dusting the arguments off and even going so far as to legitimize the Franco dictatorship.\n\nThis process of radicalization or awakening of ideologies aligned to those of the far-right has been reinforced by the refugee crisis, also increasing the rejection of immigrants in Spain. Thus, new parties and political groups belonging to the far-right have emerged and many of the most reactionary arguments have even been taken on and defended by moderate parties (\u00c1lvarez-Benavides, 2018). The barometers of the Sociological Research Center (CIS) from 2017 and 2018 show how both individual ideological self-location, as well as that of the parties, as well as the agreed definition of the main problems of Spain, tend towards increasingly conservative, radical and exclusionary positions.\n\nThe intentions and demands of the post-2011 social movements, including 15M, were tremendously ambitious and hopeful. But the political, social and economic reality at national and international level instead carries a certain sense of disaffection and failure.\n\nHowever, there are also a whole series of reasons to be optimistic, changes and new trends that have their origin and their being in 15M.\n\nThe most obvious are the new political parties. At the national level, Podemos stands out, with delegations in all the autonomous communities and in the main municipalities. But other types of regional groupings have emerged, such as AhoraMadrid, Barcelona en Com\u00fa, la marea Atl\u00e1ntica, Zaragoza en Com\u00fan, etc. Through pacts with other parties and initiatives from the left, these groupings have accessed several autonomous parliaments, ruling in coalition and even reaching the mayorship of cities such as Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia, C\u00e1diz, Zaragoza and A Coru\u00f1a. These are the so-called \"governments for change\".\n\nThe process of institutionalizing these new parties has been dizzying, its initial fresh zeal having been lost along the way and perhaps the most transformative and ambitious aspirations along with it. This has generated criticism (\u00c1lvarez-Benavides, 2016), but also some stability.\n\nWhile the initial perspective called for a storming of the heavens, as Pablo Iglesias once put it, at present the social mass that sustains these new parties and governments seems stable, which allows for some medium-term political planning.\n\nThe incoming governments for change policies have had an open social character. The initiatives surrounding public housing, the remunicipalisation processes of basic public services and the control of national and local economic oligarchies, stand out, having established important fines for non-compliance with services. All processes of privatization of hospitals and other public services have been stopped in their tracks.\n\nThere has also been a significant boost to environmental measures, working to make cities more sustainable, friendlier towards citizens, restricting the usage of cars, increasing green spaces, pedestrianizing large spaces. These radical municipal groupings have also proven to be excellent managers, reducing public debt at a much higher speed and to a much greater extent than the municipalities and communities in which traditional parties govern, while at the same time increasing social spending[6].\n\nDespite the resistances, the difficulties and the short time spent, the new policy is building a democracy that advances the recovery and extension of social rights, in which corruption is punished with strict self-imposed ethical codes, with a greater budget transparency, and with a commitment to the general public and to large corporations' detriment. These new policies have brought with them, therefore, a better democracy, but also more democracy, with the implementation of a whole series of participatory processes that range from participation in the municipal budget's management of parcels to the design and rehabilitation of public spaces.\n\nMany of 15M's demands have been permeating into the new politics and the new parties, but the new faces, the new generations, the new ethical dimension of the new progressive governments, also has its counterpart, at least to some extent, in the general political sphere, as well as in the traditional one.\n\nBeyond the advance of some reactionary ideas, the truth is that at the same time the ideas of the new policy have permeated into the traditional parties, the ethical codes of the parties have hardened and there is a greater control on the citizens' influence over policy and politicians.\n\nAlthough this does not directly translate into a majority change of tendency in the vote, it does so with respect to its legitimacy, even by the most conservative voters. This reformulation of political legitimacy has resulted, for example, in the fact that after the Popular Party was condemned for corruption, the remaining political parties of the Congress, with the exception of Ciudadanos, dissolved the government of Mariano Rajoy through a no-confidence motion, which in turn provoked a process of political renewal in the conservative party.\n\nDespite the fact that corruption continues to be a plague, it is punished more and more in the judiciary, with model and exemplary condemnations, and with almost 1500 politicians charged and a hundred in jail, including the King's own brother-in-law.\n\nToday it seems unlikely that a politician charged with corruption will not end up resigning. But these constraints exercised on the general public's behalf and the politicians themselves are being more and more extended, so that, for example, in the new socialist government two ministers have resigned for ethical reasons (the minister of health for doubts generated around her claims to a master's degree and the minister of culture for having been fined for tax-evasion before becoming a minister). There have also been similar resignations in the Popular Party and other formations.\n\n15M, the \"Indignados\" movement, has had a very important symbolic and pragmatic dimension to it, such that this has constituted a before and an after in Spanish politics and society. It is true that the magnitude and dimension of the changes that were demanded have survived only as a series of much smaller transformations; and that this real democracy, increasingly broad and participative, has not just arrived as expected, but that the struggle for equality and social justice will continue beyond what we imagined, with advances but also with many setbacks.\n\nSociety is created and recreated through social movements (Touraine, 1973), but also through the dominant elites and counter-movements (Pleyers and \u00c1lvarez-Benavides, 2018). As a consequence of the 15M, new parties and political formations have been born, citizen movements, new initiatives and ways of understanding and doing politics. But this is not a process confined to progressives. Conservatives, nationalists and even the far-right have also found new forms.\n\nThe old politics, the traditional parties, have been affected by 15M. But clearly their readjustments rarely favour the demands made on the squares and at the assemblies. Instead they attempt to counteract the effects of the new policy, to recover their former predominant position and to continue dictating the game's norms and rules. In this see-saw also the economic elites, who were minimally affected, have mobilized to neutralize the impulses of both the post-2011 movements and their political translations. Nothing is a free gift under neoliberalism.\n\nBut beyond political issues, the struggle between new and old parties, even the fact that we can already talk about a new policy, there is a transformation of mentalities. Although little time has passed, and it is difficult, in itself, to make an assessment on this type of transformation, it can be seen that 15M's sediment, as had happened with May '68 and as it would also go on to happen with the Arab Spring, will remain and will affect many generations.\n\nTherefore, 15M is history, present and future. The 15M movement is history itself, because it is a milestone that will be studied, read and remembered by generations of activists and citizens not yet mobilized, because it will be a mirror in which to look back, because whenever there is a demonstration or a new social movement is born, reference will be made to everything that had happened during those months and that will be newly disseminated, to a greater or lesser extent. Present, because today politics are already different, whether or not democracy advances. The very conception of democracy is already different for many citizens, even to some extent for those who are the furthest ideologically from 15M. Future, because many of those activists who experienced democracy in the squares or on social networks, continue fighting for the same reasons that called them to demonstrate, to make assemblies, to demand more and better democracy, more social rights and social justice in the first place. Some of them, from the new parties that make up the governments-for-change and that will form new governments and opposition governments in which policy will be made as had been envisaged, in part, during 15M.\n\nOthers, most of them, throughout their daily life, in their neighbourhoods, with their neighbours, with their colleagues, with their families, will continue to make the politics seen at the squares, that of the assemblies, that of a local level. They will continue practicing day-to-day democracy in its purest form. They will continue to be outraged, and will continue to be 15M.\n\nUnder the motto \"We have been and will be again\", people protest on the first anniversary of the referendum on independence, Barcelona.

      "body": "MADRID -- Forty years after its creation, Spain's constitution is back in the political limelight.\n\nDrafted three years after the death of dictator Francisco Franco, the document -- seen as the linchpin of the country's so-called transition from authoritarian rule to parliamentary democracy -- has attained an almost mythical status among many Spaniards.\n\nBut as supporters gathered at a flurry of commemorative events in the Spanish capital this month, calls to reform a democratic system some have taken to calling a \"sham\" are getting louder.\n\n\"Spain has a major upheaval every 40 years and right now we're in one of them,\" said Andalusia's Socialist president, Susana D\u00edaz, pointing to a trend that goes back beyond the transition to the 1936-39 civil war and the country's humiliating loss of key colonies in 1898.\n\nSpain pursued the road to democracy at high speed, soon becoming a member of the EU and NATO.\n\nThe 1978 constitution marked the end of Francoism and the country's first steps on the road to democracy. But a series of institutional crises, driven by political corruption and Catalan nationalism, has spurred a growing sense that the country is ripe for another upheaval.\n\nAround the corner from an open-air concert to celebrate the anniversary in front of the Spanish Congress in central Madrid earlier this month, demonstrators gathered to demand the release of people they described as political prisoners: activists, artists and performers jailed for their public statements or their art. \"The transition is a farce,\" they shouted.\n\n\"It does seem like a farce to us, given the cuts to human rights and the situation we're going through,\" said 64-year-old Carmina Ram\u00edrez, who took part in the protest. She described the constitution and the democratization process she witnessed as a young woman as \"a deal done by those at the top, the elites.\"\n\n\"We've got to get over all this hoopla about 1978,\" she said. \"It may have got us this far but times have changed.\"\n\nIf there's one point on which defenders and critics of the \"transition\" agree, it's that the constitution's success depended on a remarkable degree of consensus. Former members of the right-wing Franco regime worked together with moderates and leftists -- some of whom had been in jail or exile during the dictatorship.\n\n\"You have to understand that we'd come out of a long, 40-year dictatorship whose foundations were in a dramatic civil war that caused wounds which still hadn't healed when the constitutional project was begun,\" said Miquel Roca, a member of a small group of jurists who drew up the new constitution.\n\nSpain pursued the road to democracy at high speed, soon becoming a member of the EU and NATO. By the nineties, it was an influential European economic power and its transformation was lauded worldwide. The constitution was seen as the underpinning of that success.\n\nBut the last decade has corroded Spain's self-perception of a model democratic state. Dozens of corruption scandals rocked the Socialist Workers' Party and the conservative Popular Party, the two major political parties that have dominated national politics since the transition. Coming in the wake of the 2008 economic crisis that left millions of Spaniards out of work and impoverished, it left the country dispirited and distrustful.\n\nThen came the arguably more damaging Catalan independence movement and the government's crackdown. Madrid imposed direct rule in the region. Many independence leaders and activists fled abroad or were arrested.\n\nThe standoff put new strains on one of the centerpieces of the constitution -- which seeks to balance the demands of Spain's 17 regions with the \"inseparable unity of the Spanish Nation.\" It also placed some of the country's main democratic institutions under fierce scrutiny. Chief among them: the judiciary.\n\nWith nine Catalan independence leaders in jail -- in some cases for over a year -- the independence movement and many on the left have questioned the judgment of the Spanish Supreme Court, which is handling the case. A 2018 EU scorecard placed Spain 23rd -- below Portugal, Hungary and Romania -- in a top-to-bottom ranking of how favorably the public views the independence of its country's justice system.\n\nMeanwhile, a string of cases in which social media users, rappers and other artists have been jailed for allegedly glorifying terrorist groups such as ETA -- which has disbanded and has not killed in almost a decade -- has also sparked outrage in many quarters.\n\n\"We are worried about the state of health of freedom of speech in Spain,\" said Ignacio Gonz\u00e1lez Vega, spokesman for the progressive Judges for Democracy association.\n\nSome have suggested that the roots of the crisis lie in the hasty, often untransparent way the constitution was cobbled together.\n\nIn his book, \"Institutions of Modern Spain,\" Michael T. Newton notes that the roles of key institutions were not sufficiently negotiated.\n\n\"While the end might have justified the means, many cracks were papered over,\" he wrote. \"Many agreements were reached not in the committee rooms of the [parliament] but behind closed doors in party offices or Madrid restaurants.\"\n\nThe fact that there have been only two constitutional reforms over the last 40 years reflects how reluctant Spain's political class is to meddle with its Magna Carta.\n\nAlthough 70 percent of Spaniards want constitutional reform of some sort, according to a recent poll by the Center for Sociological Research (CIS), the question is how -- and how far.\n\nThe \"constant celebration\" of the constitution by older Spaniards is not shared by many of their younger countrymen, said political scientist Jos\u00e9 Fern\u00e1ndez-Albertos. Left-leaning voters also tend to advocate a deeper change than those on the right.\n\nThe territorial model and judiciary are often cited as obvious candidates for reform, as is the closed electoral list system, the monarchy's male-oriented succession and regulations that allow opaque party financing practices.\n\nThe fact that there have been only two constitutional reforms over the last 40 years -- in 1992, to accommodate the Maastricht Treaty, and in 2011, to guarantee budgetary stability during the eurozone crisis -- reflects how reluctant Spain's political class is to meddle with its Magna Carta.\n\nThe only major party ready to buck that trend in recent years has been Podemos. When the leftist, anti-austerity party erupted as a political force in 2014, it promised to blast open \"the padlock of '78.\"\n\nBut after getting a taste of the practical difficulties of introducing constitutional reform -- which requires two-thirds of parliament's support in a heavily polarized political landscape -- Podemos rarely uses such language today.\n\nBlaming the constitution and the transition for modern Spain's ills may be tempting, but it is ultimately misguided, said Fern\u00e1ndez-Albertos. \"It makes narrative sense to associate the choices made back then with the situation we have right now,\" he said. \"[But] if certain things fail, it's not so much because in the constitution, there's a clause put there by some military guy who was linked to the Franco regime but because Spain's current political dynamic is the way it is.\"\n\nCritics of the constitution also tend to play down its considerable successes -- not just in guiding the country through the turmoil of its early years of democracy but in ensuring political stability, and a certain degree of prosperity, under both leftist and conservative governments in the decades that followed.\n\nIndeed, some of the most frequently cited faults in Spanish democracy -- such as its tribalism and lack of representation -- can also be seen in many other European nations today.\n\nWhat many Spaniards seem to yearn for, whether or not it involves an overhaul of their constitution, is a return to the statesmanlike, consensual attitudes that created it -- the so-called spirit of the transition.\n\nWith the country at a crossroads, Spain has to put aside \"the party tricks\" and avoid the temptation of ideological polarization, political scientist Francisco J. Llera said.\n\n\"This moment is historic and, as was the case back then, requires responsibility, moderation, generosity and pacts by our elites.\"",

      "title": "'If the new 50p really meant to commemorate Brexit, it should feature Nigel Farage'",
      "body": "There will be no new royal yacht, no commemorative Brexit stamps, but there will, we now know, be a coin to honour Brexit.\n\nIn the budget this afternoon, Philip Hammond will announce that when the UK leaves the EU, the Royal Mint will issue a new 50p, on which will appear the quotation \"Friendship With All Nations.\"\n\nIt does not reference Brexit specifically, but it is a gentle nod to the \"Global Britain\" marketing campaign the government has been deploying since the moment the country voted to leave the European Union. That's a marketing campaign those who actually campaigned for Brexit deliberately rejected, by the way, because it didn't work in 1975, it's never worked since, and they knew it wouldn't work now. If the coin really wanted to commemorate Brexit, it'd have Nigel Farage on the back of it grinning in front of a desperate line of refugees, or some lies about spending on the NHS.\n\nIt shouldn't be controversial to point out that until now the reason all the campaigns to issue commemorative Brexit-related national merchandise have failed is that those who would issue such things have been acutely aware that Brexit is the most divisive thing that has happened the history of the United Kingdom. (The civil war was arguably more divisive, but that was merely England, at least at first).\n\nFor roughly half the population, the Brexit coin will be carried like a badge of pride. For the other half, it will burn in their pocket with shame. For about a decade and a half, Glasgow Rangers and Glasgow Celtic football clubs decided to have the same shirt sponsor. It was correctly deduced that if one half of the city wore Carling lager or NTL broadband, the other half of the city would instantly self-impose an embargo on the product in question.\n\nTo this end, I confidently predict that the Brexit 50p will disappear from circulation in a matter of months, when some silly Twitter Remainer hashtag campaign gets going, and the more unhinged reaches of the #FBPE community start sucking them from the streets and storing them in jars.\n\nThere's also the unfortunate fact the quotation in question comes from Thomas Jefferson, the full quote extending to include the words, \"entangling alliances with none.\" It is widely understood as a defence of American isolationism.\n\nIt's a noble sentiment, perhaps, but Jefferson did not utter his words while walking out of an alliance with his 27 nearest neighbours, in an act that threatens severe damage to their prosperity as well as our own. Britain may seek friendship with all nations, but it has shown itself to be a very unreliable friend, and a selfish one too.\n\nOne imagines the line in question is meant to convey the spirit of Brexit, about free trade over political integration, but it doesn't have much to say on whether Britain's \"friendship with all nations\" extends to the large number of nations who are currently actively seeking to block the independent trading schedules the UK is in the process of submitting to the World Trade Organisation.\n\nQuite who Britain's friends in the world are meant to be is not made clear either. New Zealand and Australia continue to queue up to sort out trading arrangements with the European Union. Various African leaders laugh at civil service talk or \"Empire 2.0\". Japan has sent furious letters to the UK government, urgently seeking clarification on the UK's future status within the single market, in accordance with promises it was made by Margaret Thatcher which it has now gone back on.\n\nThere was one leading politician who was so thrilled at Brexit that she changed her Twitter picture to the Union Jack for several days after the Brexit vote. But unfortunately for us, Marine Le Pen of France's National Front would lose her own presidential election shortly after. A real blow for us, that one.\n\nAll around the world, democracies are in a mess. Brazil has just freely elected a racist, far-right homophobe the latest in a long line of bizarre electoral outcomes, from Trump, to Mexico, to the Philippines, to the Catalan independence movement. And these outcomes are widely being attributed to the inability of democratic societies with free speech to control the radicalising influence of social media, and particularly Facebook, upon them. That's a problem that will be hard for the world to solve. But only Britain's descent into it will come with a commemorative coin, a national event, a momentous decision that will not, in the routine business of democratic events, come with a chance to be revisited.",
